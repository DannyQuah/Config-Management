(2020.09.07.0632) Add comment to https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki/issues/950 VimWiki problem with filenames that have dots: 
I have the same problem but in a direction that is not yet explicitly mentioned. The issue arises even when I try to access a file that already exists. In my usage, when following a filename link, vimwiki actively removes extension in the filename, not just fails to add the extension. Test case: 
1. I have (top-directory) file `Nexts-2020.05.md` already extant.
2. When `index.md` links to `Nexts-2020.05.md`, Enter tries to open file `Nexts-2020.05` (which doesn't exist). 
3. If, however, `index.md` links to `Nexts-2020.05.md.md` (i.e., when I put in an extra `.md` at the end), then Enter works and correctly opens the intended file `Nexts-2020.05.md`.

I have confirmed this with `vimwiki_markdown_link_ext` set to 0 and to 1. In my use it is in creating the link that the 0/1 setting to this matters. When 0, if I hit Enter on `1.1` (say) then the link generated is `(1.1)`. But when 1, then vimwiki generates link `(1.1.md)`. In the second case, however, hitting Enter again strips the `.md` extension when vimwiki tries to open or create the file.
