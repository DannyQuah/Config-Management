(2020.09.06.1155) I'm running on Team LKYSPP to raise funds for Singapore Cancer Society programs. So, if you feel you want to help, any amount you can donate would further incentivise my completing my 42km run.

Can I confirm if JihongJu's commit has been merged into main? Or if not, what remains to be worked out before it can be? As far as I can tell the missing ' remains missing. 

(I don't know if this is the same or a separate issue, but even after I put in the missing ' on my local copy, I still can't get  vim_markdown_preview_toggle=1 to render at all. Having vim_markdown_preview_toggle=0 works fine, however.)

In ~/.vim/bundle/vim-markdown-preview/plugin/vim-markdown-preview.vim l132 add a single quote before `vim-markdown-preview.html`:

``` 
% diff vim-markdown-preview.vim vim-markdown-preview-original.vim 
132c132
<     let chrome_wid = system("xdotool search --name 'vim-markdown-preview.html - " . g:vim_markdown_preview_browser . "'")
---
>     let chrome_wid = system("xdotool search --name vim-markdown-preview.html - " . g:vim_markdown_preview_browser . "'")
```
(But I still can't get to work what ought to be rendering with images, i.e., HTML generation in current working directory. Having vim_markdown_preview_toggle=0 works fine, however.)

(2020.09.06.2247) YAML headers mess up markdown files on display if the front and back `---` don't match exactly: Watch out for trailing whitespace. 
(2020.09.06.2331) I still cannot get VimWiki to open files with periods in their names (like `Vim-2020.05.md` or `Vim-2020.05.wiki`) However, if I leave the .ext in vimwiki_list as '.wiki' while the wiki files I reference explicitly I give the '.md' extension, then they do open. But when I leave these extensions different then `VWS` does not search them. And vimwiki still has to automatically generate files (like `index`, `diary`, and `YYYY-MM-DD` calendar files) with `.wiki` extensions.
