Associate Professor Kenneth Paul Tan, from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, said he hopes the review on dormitories, when it comes, will take in diverse voices from civil society in policy discussions.
“And I hope, most of all, that we have deeper discussions with a view to minimising our dependency on low-waged migrant workers, investing in productivity-enhancing technology, redesigning essential jobs to overcome unnecessary stigma, and designing more generous social safety nets for the many who will have difficulty integrating into a new and more resilient economic society.”


Singapore has to reduce reliance on low-wage foreign workers but will always need them: Chan Chun Sing. Today Online (30 May 2020)

"The explosion of Covid-19 cases in foreign worker dormitories has sparked calls by some for Singapore to reduce its population of migrant workers.
But business leaders have [hit back at such calls](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/industry-associations-hit-back-calls-reduced-reliance-migrant-workers), saying such a move would have a negative impact on the economy.

Industry associations hit back at calls for reduced reliance on migrant workers. Today Online (27 May 2020)
https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/industry-associations-hit-back-calls-reduced-reliance-migrant-workers
"[...] trade and industry associations have criticised the calls for Singapore to reduce its reliance on foreign workers, saying that such a move would have a negative impact on the economy."

"[...] these associations also argued that housing conditions for migrant workers, which have come under fire since the COVID-19 outbreak erupted in the dormitories last month, are among the best in the world."

"The statements come as political observers, policy thinkers and parliamentarians recently called for a rethink of Singapore’s reliance on migrant labour in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has infected more than 30,000 dormitory residents as of May 26."

"As of December last year, there were around 737,200 work permit holders who were not domestic workers in Singapore. Around 293,300 of these work permit holders worked in the construction sector, while others took on various jobs in the manufacturing, cleaning, marine, electrical and other technical trades."

3. Impact on cost and standard of living
4. Firms not yet ready to transit away from migrant labour
4. Singapore has good reputation among migrant workers

"Can Singapore rely less on foreign workers? It's not just about dollars and cents, say observers." CNA (09 Jun 2020)
