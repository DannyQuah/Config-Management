"I filed a GIRO application form in early June for OCBC payment to my
American Express card. On 20 July I received an SMS from OCBC that GIRO
payment to American Express Int would indeed be made via GIRO. However,
this morning I received an email from American Express that payment had
not been made. Please let me know what I need to do to have those
payments automatically made. Thank you."

We do not have an IBAN as it is a banking identification number usually
used by European banks only.

(2018.02.16 12:44) OCBC Credit card & rewards enquiry (ref no.:
2018021601802995) &lt;-

I have had a Giro automatic payment to my 365 Credit Card (\*-3760)
since 08 Jan 2018 (screenshot attached). However, yesterday I got a
telephone call from an OCBC representative saying that my payment on
that card was overdue (incorporating both Jan and Feb bills). I paid the
amount via Internet right away, but I am thinking this shouldn't have
happened. Moreover, I got charged a Late Penalty and interest charges,
and likely my credit record has been blemished with this incident. I
called and spoke to an OCBC representative (Wei Tian?) yesterday
morning, who said he would look into why this happened. I write this
message to provide further evidence and to ask for a resolution of this
incident. If the fault is not mine, I would like to ask for
reimbursement of the extra charges and correcting of my credit record. I
also need to know if the Giro will have kicked in for next month's
payment so this doesn't happen again. Thank you.

didn't go through; can I also get the \$100 late charge reimbursed?)
